The data on Dengue incidence reported by Funk et al. (2016) cover the period
from 2011-09-15 to 2012-02-14, over which time a total of 157 clinical cases
were reported among 294 residents. The first reported case is thought to be
the index case. The population of Fais is concentrated in a single population
centre, and is thought to have been immunologically naive at the time of
infection.
