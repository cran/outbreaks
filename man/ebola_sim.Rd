\description{
This simulated outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease matches some key properties of the West African
Ebola outbreak of 2014-2015. Specifically, care was taken to use realistic delays (incubation
period, serial interval, time to hospitalisation, etc.) and reproduction number (see references).
}
\details{
This dataset is used for teaching purposes during Imperial College's short course on infectious
disease modelling. The exercise aims to simulate the response to an Ebola outbreak taking place
in a single large city, and evaluate the impact of an intervention (increased bed capacity).

Note that to ensure realism, some errors have been introduced in this dataset. These can be
identified as negative incubation periods (delay from infection to onset of symptoms). See
example for a simple way to identify these cases. The dataset \code{ebola_sim_clean} is the same
dataset, only dates of infection and onset have been set to 'NA'.
}
\examples{
## identify mistakes in data entry (negative incubation period)
mistakes <- which(ebola_sim$linelist$date_of_onset <= ebola_sim$linelist$date_of_infection)
mistakes
ebola_sim$linelist[mistakes, ]

## check that ebola_sim_clean is identical after removing mistakes
identical(ebola_sim_clean$linelist, ebola_sim$linelist[-mistakes, ])
