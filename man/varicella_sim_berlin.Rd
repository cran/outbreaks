\section{Background}{

This dataset is useful to compute incidence rates.

This dataset simulates an outbreak of varicella in german centers for
foreigners. It is loosely based on the situation in 2015, when the numbers of
foreigners seeking asylum exeded the available places in the center for
foreigners. Varicella was the most frequent disease in these centers at that
time.  comparable with kindergartens and other shelters.
